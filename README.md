# Showcase-db

Showcase db is a user based web app that lets you track and organize data about the shows or concerts you have attended. Users can login with Google credentials, add showcases including information such as the headliner, opening acts, venue, date, and tour, add comments or descriptions, and see a list of all the showcases they have created.
